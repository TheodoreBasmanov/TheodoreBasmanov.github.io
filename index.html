    <section class="section-left"><h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>Hi! My name is Teddy and you're on my personal website (sounds like something from the nineties? It sure does).<br> 
        I'm a junior year student from Saint-Petersburg majoring in Internet Technologies and Programming. Here you can find all the links and information about me. <br>
        As you can probably tell I like writing and used to write reviews but currently I'm more interested in (fan)fiction and essays. <br>
        I watch a lot of different movies, series and cartoons and especially love sci-fi and fantasy. A few years ago I got into musical theatre and have been absolutely enamoured by it ever since (my favourite musical/rock opera is "Jesus Christ Superstar" and specifically the 2000 movie). I'm trying to read a lot even if I do not always manage - I read mostly non-fiction about biology and/or history but I also like fantasy and historical novels. <br>
        I like history in all its shapes and forms (to the point that everybody in high school used to tell me that I should be a historian :)) and the period I'm most interested in is XVI century Russia<a href="#movie-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
    <aside name="movie-ref"><p><sup>1</sup>What's my favourite historical movie? I'll give you three guesses the first two don't count. ;)</p></aside>
    <p> I also like learning languages, even if I'm not especially successful in learning a lot of them. <br>
        My taste in music is chaotic, to say the least, but I like a lot of Russian rock and soundtracks to above mentioned musical theatre pieces.</p>

    <section class="section-right"><h4>Fandoms</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Elder Scrolls</b> (and specifically Oblivion and Morrowing) - videogames that feel like home.</li>
            <li><b>Star Trek</b> - have watched almost all of it until HBO started releasing three new series every year.</li>
            <li><b>Avatar: The Last Airbander, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, Star VS The Forces of Evil, Over the Garden Wall</b> - some cartoons (and their comics extensions) I love but never engaged with the fandom much.</li>
            <li><b>Bubble Comics</b> - stuck on the first phase but I'm working on it.</li>
            <li><b>The Witcher</b> - books and the series.</li>
            <li><b>Musical Theatre</b> - I like too many musicals and operas to list them all here.</li>
            <li><b>Redacted and Hollow</b> - current hyperfixations (audio storytelling).</li>

    <section class="section-left"><h4>Code Example</h4>
    <p>So that you know that I'm not lying about knowing any programming languages, here's a transaction class from a Banking System task from OOP class.
    <pre><code>
public abstract class Transaction {
    static ArrayList<Transaction> transactions = new ArrayList<Transaction>();
    protected static int ID = 1;
    int id;
    double summ;
    boolean isCanceled = false;
        
    abstract void undo() throws Exceptions.AlreadyCanceled;
        
    static void undo(int id) 
    throws Exceptions.IncorrectIDTransaction, 
    Exceptions.AlreadyCanceled {
        for (int i = 0; i < transactions.size(); i++) {
            if (transactions.get(i).id == id) {
                transactions.get(i).undo();
                return;
            }
        }
        throw new Exceptions.IncorrectIDTransaction();
    }
        
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o == this) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(o instanceof Transaction)) {
            return false;
        }
        Transaction c = (Transaction) o;
        return id == c.id;
    }
        
}
    </code></pre></p>

        scroll that far anyway</h4>
    <blockquote>What an appalling state of affairs when you find yourself being tortured not by an enemy 
        but by a bureaucrat. Take a look at my left arm. His Imperial Majesty's specialists sawed it off 
        in three stages; and each order was accompanied by a lengthy official correspondence. 
        Those butchers were just doing a disagreeable, boring, unrewarding job. 
        While they were sawing off my arm, they cursed their wretchedly low pay. And I was terrified. 
        I had to strain my willpower to keep from talking. And now... I can see how you hate me. <br>
