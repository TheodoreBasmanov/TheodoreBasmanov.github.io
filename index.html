        scroll that far anyway</h4>
    <blockquote>What an appalling state of affairs when you find yourself being tortured not by an enemy 
        but by a bureaucrat. Take a look at my left arm. His Imperial Majesty's specialists sawed it off 
        in three stages; and each order was accompanied by a lengthy official correspondence. 
        Those butchers were just doing a disagreeable, boring, unrewarding job. 
        While they were sawing off my arm, they cursed their wretchedly low pay. And I was terrified. 
        I had to strain my willpower to keep from talking. And now... I can see how you hate me. <br>
        <cite>"Prisoners of Power" by A. and B. Strugatsky</cite>
